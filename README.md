## Main and options menus
> Godot v4.1.3.stable.mono.official

Sample main menu, empty options menu
with "pausing/unpausing" and "giving up"
on top of [First Person Controller](https://github.com/Graunder/Godot_FirstPersonController) that 
can be removed and replaced with a different controller. 

Both repos are based on Youtube tutorials and further experimentation.
