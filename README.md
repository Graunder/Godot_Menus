## Main and options menus
> Godot v4.1.3.stable.mono.official

Sample main menu, empty options menu
with game pausing/unpausing and giving up
on top of my [First Person Controller](https://github.com/Graunder/Godot_FirstPersonController).

Both repos are based on Youtube tutorials and further experimentation.
